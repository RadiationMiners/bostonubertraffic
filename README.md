# Description of the project
Ride-sharing on Uber and Lyft has exploded in popularity in the past decade. The growth of these companies has far surpassed legislators' abilities to regulate them and city planners' abilities to design cities around the services. Public transit has been a staple of Boston since 1947, with the creation of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) \cite{wikipedia_2018}. We aim to use Uber travel times in Boston as well as data provided by the MBTA on the reliability of rail, subway, and bus routes to establish a link between delays in MBTA service and an increase in traffic times. With this link, we then hope to train an algorithm to predict delays in traffic given delays in public transit.
